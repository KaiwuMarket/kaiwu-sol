# KaiWu - Secure, seamless on-chain Trading Platform for LABUBU and Trendy Treasures.

KaiWu redefines the trendy collectibles space, from LABUBU to niche gems. Our platform eliminates the gap between physical and on-chain collecting, offering a secure, intuitive hub to manage collections and accelerate light asset circulation.

# Project Status & Development Plan

## Current Status (Hackathon Build)

The hackathon version implements the core functional loop:

- Admin can create and list items on the marketplace.

- Users can connect their wallet, browse listed items, purchase collectibles, and initiate delivery requests.

- The on-chain logic is built using Anchor framework, with NFT ownership and transaction states stored on Solana Devnet.

## Next Development Plan
We are now expanding Kaiwu beyond the minimal demo toward a fully functional version that includes:

- [ ] User-side listing and resale flow (allowing verified creators to mint and trade)

- [ ] On-chain warehouse metadata binding for provenance and authenticity tracking

- [ ] LPDT-compliant asset module for Hong Kongâ€™s regulatory framework

- [ ] Improved frontend experience with dynamic state updates and transaction history

- [ ] Integration of delivery tracking and off-chain logistics APIs

This roadmap will evolve into the Kaiwu MVP Release (Mainnet-ready)
